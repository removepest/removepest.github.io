<p>This involves using other living things that are enemies of a pest in order to control it. Often, the term" biological control" has actually been utilized in a broad context to incorporate a complete spectrum of biological organisms and biologically based items including scents, resistant plant ranges, and autocidal methods such as sterile insects.</p>
