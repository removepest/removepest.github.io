<p>Some of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, effective versus sucking pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, reliable versus red cotton bug, cutworms, insects; botanical mixes, mixes of extracts from different plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, chilly, gliricidia, marigold, and so on</p>
