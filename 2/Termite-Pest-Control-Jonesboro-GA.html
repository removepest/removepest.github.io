<p>IPM approaches consist of both chemical and nonchemical means to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest reliable dose when other approaches of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, environment control, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll utilize the most selective pesticide that will do the job and be the most safe for other organisms and for water, soil, and air quality; use pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds rather of an entire area. Due to any number of reasons, consisting of those pointed out in the Chemical and Cultural areas, jeopardizing the effectiveness of natural opponents frequently enables possible pest organisms to experience essentially unregulated population development and enables them to reach pest status.</p>
