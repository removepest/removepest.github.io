<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the tiniest reliable dose when other techniques of pest control have actually stopped working.

<p>With IPM you'll use the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the most safe for other organisms and for soil, air, and water quality; use pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds instead of a whole location. Due to any number of factors, consisting of those pointed out in the Chemical and Cultural sections, jeopardizing the efficiency of natural opponents frequently allows prospective pest organisms to experience practically unregulated population growth and allows them to reach pest status.</p>
