To determine IPM adoption, it is needed to determine the elements that determine whether a pest control program qualifies as an IPM system. Pest-tolerant crops such as soybeans may not call for interventions unless the pests are numerous or rapidly increasing.</p>
<p>Typically, the main aim of IPM programmes is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, initially established for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now developed to incorporate diseases, weeds, and other pests that may disrupt the management objectives of sites such as business and residential structures, lawn and grass areas, and house and community gardens.</p>
