The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, appropriate irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents.

<h3>Tips for Selecting a Reputable Pest Control Company Boone NC</h3>
<p>Although several sources define IPM in various methods, previous models mainly concentrated on the environmental, and to some extent on the evolutionary, elements of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A recent IPM pyramid provided by Stenberg (2017) recognized an absence of a holistic IPM approach that uses both modern and traditional tools.</p>
<p>Biological pest control measures benefit from the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial job is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed. Knowledge of these limits and dynamics of pests and natural enemies helps to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even fix structural damage brought on by termites.</p>
