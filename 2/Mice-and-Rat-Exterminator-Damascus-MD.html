<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the environment as a whole and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most effective and least harmful plan.</p>
<p>In reference to the concept of incorporating the use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on widened to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
