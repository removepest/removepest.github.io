<p>The decision of the correct reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides poisonous to a lot of insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively affect natural enemies than products that are narrow-spectrum or selective for specific insect types or life phases.</p>

And vice versa, pest management specialists can use video to record and tell assessments and leave a copy for the center supervisor by means of e-mail, or perform a real-time video co-inspection with the consumer if they are not able to be present at their center during the evaluation.</p>
<p>Think about alternative methods (besides pesticides) to make your home and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from becoming a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from getting in a building. Current missions for reliable, safe, and enduring pest management programs have been targeted primarily toward development of brand-new and better products with which to change conventional poisonous pesticides.</p>
