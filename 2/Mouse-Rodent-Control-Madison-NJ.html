These prevention and control techniques include biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, genetic, chemical, and regulative approaches.</p>
<p>Since crop production is highly precise due to modern-day innovations on one hand, in addition to extremely variable depending on a myriad of biotic and abiotic factors and the exclusive practices of different farming operations, info management and decision-making parts play a crucial role in IPM. Utilizing IPM to prevent pest problems and lessen dependence on pesticides is the best option for a healthy environment for everyone.</p>
<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical ways to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest efficient dosage when other methods of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-lasting prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of methods such as biological control, habitat control, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
