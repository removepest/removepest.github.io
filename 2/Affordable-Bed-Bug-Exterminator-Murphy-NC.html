<p>The awareness that specific insects are carriers of organisms producing diseases in man has developed insistent demands by the notified public that control methods be established and utilized efficiently to avoid the spread of such pests. Simple hereditary manipulation to produce pest resistant plant pressures is another kind of controlling pest effects.</p>

Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplified meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost solely about decreasing pesticide use. If all other incorporated pest management strategies are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
