The classification of pesticides features multiple groups of undesirable organisms that harm crops, with a specific pesticide type for each: herbicides, rodenticides, insecticides, animal repellents, avicides, nematicides, larvicides, bactericides, fungicides, antimicrobial substances, and so on</p>
<p>Appropriate hunting likewise provides data that assist to quantify the development of pests and natural opponents.
