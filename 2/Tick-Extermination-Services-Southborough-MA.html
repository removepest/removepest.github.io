However excellent the outcomes of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) may be, it is just reasonable to say that worldwide, its release in agriculture is still in its infancy, and we are a long way from understanding everything that goes on in and around the crops we grow for food.</p>
<p>Subsidies on pesticides were minimized from 75% in 1986 to 40% in 1987 and eliminated altogether by January 1989 (APO 1993). Biological control - suggests a normal way of destroying pests as it happens in nature. Early detection of arthropod pests helps prevent the need to handle extensive populations that may trigger crop damage. Safety problems and ecological interruptions continue to take place (Wright, 1996 ), and there are restored appeals for effective, safe, and economically appropriate options (Benbrook, 1996 ). Synthetic chemical pesticides are the most extensively used technique of pest control.</p>
<p>Thus IPM is best combination of all possible techniques in pest management with least dependence on chemical pesticide. Management decisions need to be based on monitoring and population levels of insect pests, along with reputable limits. IPM addresses all the economic, environmental, and social elements and offers affordable and safe food to the revenues and customers to manufacturers and sellers, while preserving ecological health.</p>
