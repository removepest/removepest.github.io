<p>The decision of the proper cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is vital in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to many insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for specific insect types or life stages.</p>
<p>We presently do not offer pest control services for homes. Rather, the pest control service technician need to concentrate on the food handling and vending locations, using bait applications instead of spraying. They integrate cultural, biological, mechanical, physical and chemical practices to manage pests. Utilizing physical traps to control pests is potentially the most recognisable pest control measures.</p>
