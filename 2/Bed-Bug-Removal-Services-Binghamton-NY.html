<p>For some jobs, pest control employees utilize a combination of pest management techniques, a practice referred to as incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of regular examinations. Crop losses due to diseases, weeds, and arthropods, though contested by some as a valid measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the accumulation of pest control.</p>
<p>The concept of incorporated pest management (IPM), a sustainable method for managing pests, has actually remained in practice for a long time.

Cold storage is likewise thought about a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it at least stops their advancement and further feeding on the saved crop.</p>
