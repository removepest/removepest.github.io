<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the community as a whole and thinks about a balanced mix of the abovementioned control techniques to produce the most effective and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>Whether you have rodents or regular pests like ants, roaches, or spiders, we will determine the source of the issue. The goal is to provide a total understanding of the ideas of IPM, together with the concepts for execution in all crops.
