The concept of IPM is to keep track of and control pests just when they begin appearing and getting rid of the over application of pesticides in the living environmentWe are well versed with IPM techniques, Scope of works, application approaches and market particular record keeping procedures.</p>
<p>Besides this, most of the pest control companies have some fix charges for few particular locations. Natural or non-synthetic pesticides: Botanical-based pesticides fall into this IPM group.

<p>Pest management needs a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used just after routine tracking suggests that a pest population had actually reached an economic threshold level. Numerous private commodity growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM means for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are available in restricted locations.</p>
