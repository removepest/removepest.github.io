<p>Neighborhood IPM practitioners work to determine and fix pest-friendly conditions, removing access to food, water and harborage by improving sanitation, upkeep, exclusion and landscape management practices. When it declined to hunt the target types and became a pest itself, the cane toad is another case showing biological control failure in this regard.</p>
<p>Under this scheme, insect control was "supervised" by certified entomologists and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from periodic monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations. We can deal with a large range of pests discovered in Texas, including spiders, ants, termites, fleas, ticks, roaches, bed bugs, rodents and other invaders.

If much of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the hereditary basis of the future, more resistant, population.
