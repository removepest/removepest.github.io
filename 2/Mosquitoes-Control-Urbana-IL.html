<p>In recommendation to the idea of incorporating using other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on expanded to welcome collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Natural opponents can be effective, and pesticides (chemical compounds for controlling pests) are only used when alternative choices do not produce the necessary result. Expert pest control exterminators must always survey and examine before acting. The chemical pest control and the organic pest control techniques are the 2 primary different types of pest control techniques that remain in need.</p>
