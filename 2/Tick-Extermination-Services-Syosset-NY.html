<p>Efficient, less risky pest controls are picked first, including highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to interfere with pest breeding, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding.

<p>4 ). With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is deemed a economical and ecologically benign pest control method ideally fit for both little and big farmers all over the world. As soon as termites have gone into a structure, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some methods, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making procedure in which observations (from assessment and monitoring) are used to make pest control decisions based upon pre-determined management goals.</p>
