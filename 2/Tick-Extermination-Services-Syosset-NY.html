<p>Efficient, less risky pest controls are picked first, including highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to interfere with pest breeding, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding.

<p>4 ). With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is deemed a economical and ecologically benign pest control method ideally fit for both little and big farmers all over the world. As soon as termites have gone into a structure, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some methods, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making procedure in which observations (from assessment and monitoring) are used to make pest control decisions based upon pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>It keeps the use of pesticide and other interventions to levels that are economically and ecologically warranted and reduces threats to human health and the environment. In a metaanalysis of information of 145 studies, the effectiveness of either predators or parasitoids was shown to be good in reducing the variety of pests and increasing pest death (Stiling and Cornelissen, 2005).</p>
