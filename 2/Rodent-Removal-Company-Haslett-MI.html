<p>Mission Declaration: The objective of Mosquito Control is to supply Leon County residents with efficient and environmentally sound mosquito control services. Pests controlled: Use horticultural oils to fight aphids, termites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies. Under EPM, chemicals need to be used just as a last hope, after mechanical, cultural, and biological approaches have been tried and shown inadequate. Different pest control chemicals are toxic and might be damaging, if not utilized appropriately.</p>
<p>The most widely used and efficient kinds of pest control is using chemical pesticides. Modern and conventional communication tools can be utilized for outreach as researchers establish information about endemic and invasive pests, emerging dangers, and brand-new control strategies.

<p>Ecologically safe: Lots of biological control agents are eco-friendly professionals.

Research and outreach are an integral part of the IPM design to determine and expect pest problems, develop preventive and curative strategies, and efficiently share the info through standard and modern-day communication tools and strategies.</p>
