<p>Community IPM practitioners work to determine and remedy pest-friendly conditions, removing access to food, water and harborage by improving sanitation, upkeep, exemption and landscape management practices. When it declined to hunt the target species and became a pest itself, the cane toad is another case illustrating biological control failure in this regard.</p>

<p>Termites consume furnishings, papers, books, and even files kept in safes and lockers, therefore causing colossal damage within just a couple of months. This stops the pest getting resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or used to the crops. Exterminators go to customer homes and businesses to examine for insects or rodents.

Most people generally consider pest control during the warmer months, when swarms of insects try to attack their houses and backyards, however, pests know no season. A green pest management IPM program utilizes pesticides derived from plants, such as botanicals, or other naturally taking place products.</p>
