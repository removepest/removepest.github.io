<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your home unattractive to them. But home pests can likewise be a danger to your family. When looking for a place to infest, pests choose to conceal in a place that provides food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is much easier to implement in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (multiple crops).</p>
<p>If you are having actually exterminators come in to spray pesticides, put away toys and other products that young kids will desire to play with and put in their mouths.
