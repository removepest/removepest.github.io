<p>Each time the crop is scouted, record arthropod pest numbers, place within the greenhouse, and the number of plants examined. It's possible that the repeated use of pesticides might be more dangerous in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these thresholds adjust for modifications in market prices, phase of crop growth, cost of pesticides, and so on, but in reality most are based on fixed invasion or damage levels.</p>
