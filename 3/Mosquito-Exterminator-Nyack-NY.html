<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a broad-based and sustainable method that incorporates practices for the economic avoidance and control of pests and diseases in crops.  Special preventative measures need to be required to keep pest control treatments from threatening food security. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic technique to pest control.</p>
<p>In referral to the idea of integrating making use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later broadened to embrace collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been picked either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Only then can we decrease the use of artificial fertilizers, decrease dependence on pesticides and increase productivity. Here, insecticides will just be utilized when they are economically practical and it appears that natural enemies will not control the pests.
