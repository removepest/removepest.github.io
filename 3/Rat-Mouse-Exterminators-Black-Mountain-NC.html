<p>It utilizes a combination of practices and control approaches with the objective of preventing problems from reducing the requirement and happening for pesticide extensive activities such as broadacre spraying. Likewise, think about policies and treatments that might unwittingly introduce pests: storage practices and devices, upkeep, and housekeeping practices.
