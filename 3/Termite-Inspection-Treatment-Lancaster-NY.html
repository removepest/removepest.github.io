<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and dissuade pest persistence include intercropping (multiple crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>

If you reduce your exposure and take care when you come into contact with pesticides, you will reduce the possibility of harming your health. Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is a last option. Integrated pest management was conceived during the 1950s when insecticide resistance, nontarget results, and economic waste were plainly obvious (Stern et al., 1959).</p>
<p>As part of the Sustainable Usage Regulation on Pesticides, expert users of pesticides are needed to think about the principles of IPM prior to the use of chemicals. Biological pest control is a technique of controlling pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms 8 It counts on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but generally likewise includes an active human management role.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can rapidly accomplish levels at which damage is caused hence becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a wealthy community likely will have a great deal of large, pricey homes, so pest control costs might be greater there due to the fact that there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in one of those homes.</p>
