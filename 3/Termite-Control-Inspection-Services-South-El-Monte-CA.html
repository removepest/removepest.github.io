<h3>Pest Treatment South El Monte CA 91733</h3>
<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a broad-based and sustainable method that incorporates practices for the economic avoidance and control of pests and illness in crops.  Unique precautions should be taken to keep pest control treatments from threatening food safety. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic method to pest control.</p>
<p>During multiple outreach meetings and field trips organized exclusively for the general public in Southern California during the past couple of years, it was evident that a majority was not familiar with farming systems, had misunderstanding about sustainable farming, and thought that natural food is pesticide-free (Dara personal observations and unpublished survey information).</p>
<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a cost-efficient and environmentally benign pest control strategy preferably fit for both little and big farmers worldwide. As soon as termites have entered a structure, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making procedure in which observations (from assessment and monitoring) are used to make pest control decisions based upon pre-determined management objectives.</p>
