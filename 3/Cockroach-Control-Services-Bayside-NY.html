<p>When pest issues are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control procedures are needed. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulas or its cry toxic substances in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>
<p>But It is because of these increasing number of pests that our living environment is turning increasingly more unhygienic which in turn is resulting in the spread of so many diseases which were unknown to humanity in ancient times. Rodent control: These furry little pests can cause a real issue in your home. Your household's wellness and the health of the environment are always our top priority with our pest control and exterminator services.</p>

Pests are a major risk that damage crops and turn farmers' efforts into a waste of time and resources. Biological insecticides, derived from naturally happening microorganisms (e.g.-- Bt, entomopathogenic fungi and entomopathogenic nematodes ), also fall in this category.</p>
