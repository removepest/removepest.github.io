Pests interact with each other, the crop, and the environment. Biological controls-- Natural biological procedures and products can offer control, with appropriate environmental effect, and often at lower expense.</p>
<p>Reliable, less risky pest controls are selected initially, consisting of extremely targeted chemicals, such as scents to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Evaluation is often one of the most crucial steps in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the process of examining an IPM program and the results it has actually generated.</p>
