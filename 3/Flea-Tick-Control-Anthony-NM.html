<p>Pest management can be defined as the approach of decreasing or removing different types of unwanted animals such as cockroaches, ants, wasps, bees, spiders, silverfish, termites, vermins, etc., from locations occupied by human beings. Numerous newer pesticides are stemmed from plants or naturally taking place substances (e.g.-- pyrethrum, nicotine and bug juvenile hormonal agent analogues), but the toxophore or active element might be altered to provide increased biological activity or stability. Most researchers concur that this will be possible only if we cultivate crops according to the idea of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>

<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal dosages of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience retarded development and feeding and go through higher parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ).
