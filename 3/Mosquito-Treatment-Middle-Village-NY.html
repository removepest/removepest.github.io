Utilizing IPM to avoid pest problems and reduce dependence on pesticides is the very best option for a healthy environment for everyone.</p>

Low-Risk Pesticides: Non-chemical approaches including avoidance are the first line of defense. Chemical controls include horticultural oils or the application of insecticides and herbicides.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been recommended as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al.
