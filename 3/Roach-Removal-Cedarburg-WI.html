<p>Monitoring and recognition lowers the risks of utilizing the wrong kind of pesticide, or using pesticides when other methods will be more effective. The benefit of the misting pest control method is that it's thought about to be environmentally friendly, it's odor-free and doesn't leave any residues that are tough to be cleaned up. Cultural practices - depend on a technique to make the crop or habitat inappropriate to pests by interfering with their oviposition choices, host plant discrimination or area by both immatures and adults.</p>
<p>In reference to the idea of integrating using biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on widened to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been selected either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
