<h3>The Do's and Don'ts of Pest Control Rosemount MN</h3>
<p>A pesticide is specified as a chemical agent used to damage or control pests. Each kind of BT is effective only on one particular bug (or group) and just on insects that really eat it. However, that doesn't indicate you can spray it indiscriminately. We are the only company in the state of Georgia to use both infrared and Termatrac T3i technology to identify pests.</p>
<p>Pests controlled: Use horticultural oils to combat aphids, mites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies. Under EPM, chemicals need to be used only as a last option, after mechanical, cultural, and biological techniques have been attempted and revealed inadequate. Various pest control chemicals are hazardous and could be hazardous, if not utilized properly.</p>
