<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a broad-based and sustainable technique that incorporates practices for the financial avoidance and control of pests and diseases in crops.  Special safety measures should be taken to keep pest control treatments from threatening food security. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic technique to pest control.</p>
<p>For instance, management of the Soybean aphid consists of entomologists who study the pest and their damage to soybean, agronomists that identify crop phase which are most susceptible to soybean aphid damage, plant pathologists who study the viruses transferred by aphid feeding, and soil researchers who study the aphids interaction with nutrient deficiencies.</p>
<p>In West Africa, the use of okra as a trap crop shows satisfying lead to battling bollworms and other cotton pests. There was a great deal of termite problem I was dealing with before and with this service I was able to control termite to a great extend. Hoffmann, M.P. and Frodsham, A.C. (1993) Natural Enemies of Veggie Bug Pests. Three disciplines, Biological Control, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and Biotechnology, have accomplished specific value in our quest for better pest control methods.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM technique by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off since growers were not all set for such an intercropping arrangement. If your facility currently makes use of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be amazed to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to move toward least-impact product or services.</p>
