<p>In recommendation to the idea of incorporating making use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later widened to embrace coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been selected either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production applies a number of the same ideas as IPM but restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to lower the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
<p>There are many agricultural practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests.
