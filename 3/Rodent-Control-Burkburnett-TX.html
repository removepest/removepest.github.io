<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents.

When you employ a pest control company, you are complimentary to invest that time doing other important things.
