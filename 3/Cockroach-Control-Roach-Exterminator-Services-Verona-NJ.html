<h3>How to Choose the Right Pest Control Service Verona NJ</h3>
<p>The best method to control pests is to make your house unattractive to them. However household pests can also be a risk to your household. When searching for a place to infest, pests choose to conceal in a location that supplies food and a safe breeding place. Biological control is much easier to carry out in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (multiple crops).</p>
<p>When stored for a long time, saved item pests are most likely to be in a food ingredient on shipment to a processing factory or a processed food item. Applying pesticides to crops, animals, structures or landscapes on a regular basis, despite need, is not IPM. The dependence on pesticides as a sole method of control has led to the development of insect resistance and unfavorable results on human health, natural enemies, and the environment.</p>
