<p>The idea of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable technique for managing pests, has been in practice for a long time. Crops genetically crafted to produce Bt contaminants are planted in millions of hectares worldwide. Cold storage is also thought about a physical control and, although it does not always kill the insect pests, it at least stops their advancement and more feeding on the saved crop.</p>
<p>Some also acknowledged that if regionally collaborated IPM might occur, even yearly management of a continuous pest might be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We recruit exterminators who focus on commercial or commercial pest control. Constant training and education of farmers represent the cornerstone for establishment of reliable and solid IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
