<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a reliable and environmentally sensitive  method to pest management that depends on a mix of sensible practices. IPM is an approach to ensure economic practicality at both consumer and producer level (seller is always expected to earn a profit), environmental security through a balanced usage of all offered pest control options, and social acceptability considering that IPM-based food is economical and safe.</p>
<p>In IPM, pesticides are utilized only when needed and in mix with other approaches for more efficient, long-term control. The advantages of GM crops extend beyond the decrease in insecticides, due to the fact that they are compatible with other pest management techniques, especially biological control. Determine the most effective pesticide for your pest problem and ensure the pesticide you pick is created for the pest you mean to utilize it on.</p>
<p>All nations acknowledged IPM as a preferable technique to pest control even if it was not extensively embraced. Pests are a major threat that damage crops and turn farmers' efforts into a waste of time and resources. Biological insecticides, originated from naturally occurring microbes (e.g.-- Bt, entomopathogenic nematodes and entomopathogenic fungis ), also fall in this classification.</p>
