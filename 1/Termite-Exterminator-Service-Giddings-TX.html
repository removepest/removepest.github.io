	<meta name="description" content="Professional Pest Control Company in Giddings TX - The flea control efficacies of the two oral isoxazoline formulations administered to dogs in this study were very high; were not significantly different throughout the study (Table 3 ); and were remarkably similar to results observed in previous in-home investigations conducted in Florida 7 , 24 A single oral dose of fluralaner or three-monthly oral doses of sarolaner provided over 99% efficacy against adult fleas within 7 days of treatment and efficacy in both groups was 100% at both the 8 and 12-week assessments (Table 3 ). Previously, in an almost identical study design, a single oral dose of fluralaner reduced flea populations on dogs by 99.0% within 7 days and by 100% at both the 8 and 12-week post-treatment assessments 24 Similarly, a previous Florida field study with oral sarolaner provided 99.0% reduction in flea populations on dogs at 7 days post-treatments and then further monthly doses of oral sarolaner resulted in 99.9% efficacy at 8 weeks (there was no 12 week efficacy assessment) 7 Therefore, oral isoxazoline treatments can deliver rapid and sustained flea control for dogs in subtropical Florida.">
