<h3>Things You Should Know When Hiring a Pest Control Company Lowell AR</h3>
<p>A pesticide is defined as a chemical agent utilized to damage or control pests. Each type of BT works only on one particular insect (or group) and only on insects that actually eat it. However, that doesn't imply you can spray it indiscriminately. We are the only company in the state of Georgia to utilize both termatrac and infrared T3i technology to identify pests.</p>
<p>Termites are such devastating pests that you want your termite treatment to lead to termite extermination. Once action, identification, and tracking thresholds show that pest control is required, and preventive techniques are no longer reliable or available, IPM programs then assess the proper control approach both for efficiency and risk.
