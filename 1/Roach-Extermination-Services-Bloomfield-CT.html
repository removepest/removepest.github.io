Risk for animals - pesticides eliminate non-target (harmless or beneficial) types that habituate in the fields or orchards. These pests are merely anywhere and all over, be it houses, offices, companies, dining locations, hotels etc, anywhere which is not truly maintained appropriately and is not sanitary.</p>
