<p>Each time the crop is scouted, record arthropod pest numbers, area within the greenhouse, and the number of plants inspected. It's possible that the duplicated use of pesticides might be more dangerous in the long term than the pests themselves.

<p>If you identify rogue rodents, there are numerous steps to require to make sure permanent removal of these pests.
