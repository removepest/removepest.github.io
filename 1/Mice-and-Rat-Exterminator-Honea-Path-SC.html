Pests can possess crippling effect on the healthiness of your household and when it's not controlled in the right time, they have the ability to increase, that is breed rapidly and can trigger the most damage possible.</p>
<p>When pest problems are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control procedures are needed.

<p>Some also recognized that if regionally collaborated IPM might occur, even annual management of a constant pest might be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998). We hire exterminators who specialize in commercial or business pest control. Constant training and education of farmers represent the foundation for facility of reliable and solid IPM program in agroecosystems.</p>
<p>Thus IPM is best mix of all possible methods in pest management with least dependence on chemical pesticide.

IPM addresses all the economic, ecological, and social aspects and provides safe and economical food to the customers and revenues to manufacturers and sellers, while preserving ecological health.</p>
