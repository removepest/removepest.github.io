<h3>Types of Pest Control Islip NY</h3>

Common pests, such as ants, centipedes, cockroaches, earwigs, fleas, flies, mice, moths, rats, spiders, stinging insects, termites and dozens more are conveniently covered under our pestfree365 plan-- offering year-round protection versus 36 of the most common pests.
