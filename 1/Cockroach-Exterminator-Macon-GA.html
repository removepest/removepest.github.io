A reliable IPM program consists of pesticides for avoidance and active treatment. Using entomopathogenic germs, fungis, microsporidia, nematodes, or viruses, and fermentation byproducts of some microorganisms against arthropod pests, plant parasitic nematodes, and plant pathogens usually come under microbial control (Mankau 1981, Paulitz and Bélanger 2001, Dong and Zhang 2006, Lacey 2017 ).</p>
<p>And given that pests behave differently even within a species, managing them successfully needs unique understanding of the pests themselves, in addition to ways to securely and efficientlymanage them. Important files consist of a scope of service, pest activity reports, service reports, corrective action reports, trap design maps, lists of authorized pesticides, pesticide use reports and applicator licenses.</p>
