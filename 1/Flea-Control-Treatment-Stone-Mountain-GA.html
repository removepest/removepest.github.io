<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the ecosystem as an entire and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the abovementioned control techniques to produce the most reliable and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>Farmers and growers have actually been frequently utilizing much of these IPM strategies for decades or perhaps generations - techniques such as crop rotation, not planting crops in locations prone to pests, or using tolerant or resistant ranges. Sovereign Pest Control and its affiliated companies provide quality termite and pest control services each year to over 40,000 house owners in Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Texas, and Tennessee.</p>
