The modification to constant croppring systems over large adjacent locations has actually created severe insect-pest management and control issues.</p>
<p>If, after following planned and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above threshold levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use picked biopesticides with low ecological impact.
