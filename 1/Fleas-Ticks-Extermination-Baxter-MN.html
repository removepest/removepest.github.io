<p>Of course, you might keep the crop covered for its entire life span, although this isn't a good option for crops that need insect pollination. When carrying out pest management within their house or landscape, property owners can implement their own IPM programs or request that their service suppliers utilize IPM. Classifications might include general pest control, rodent control, termite control, fumigation, and ornamental and turf control.</p>
