The company takes emergency situations seriously, so if you have an unsafe situation, such as a nest of wasps or a scorpion holding you captive in your bathroom, Orkin will do its best to offer same-day service. Considering that the early potatoes are the only food source available, the beetles will gather on these plants where they can more easily be managed.</p>
