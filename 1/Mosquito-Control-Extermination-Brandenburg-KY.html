For that reason, a mere switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural opponents, although handy in decreasing environmental contamination and security problems, still does not genuinely attend to the environmentally based weakness of the traditional pest control technique.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with invasive pest concerns, classical biological control method is usually used where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has been effectively used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
