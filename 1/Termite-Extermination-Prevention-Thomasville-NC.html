<p>SCRAM! Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and discourage pest persistence consist of intercropping (several crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>The methods typically involve using extreme chemicals to get rid of the undesirable pests. All offered methods of insect-pest management and control should be considered. Environmental impacts like dry spell tension affects pest management suggestions. This handbook becomes part of a training course on Integrated Pest Management (IPM).
