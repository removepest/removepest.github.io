<p>As a very first line of pest control, IPM programs work to manage the crop, yard, or indoor area to avoid pests from becoming a danger. Given that IPM is an intricate pest control procedure, not simply a series of practices, it is difficult to use one IPM definition for all foods and all locations of the country.
