With more guidelines on pesticide usage and a decrease in the number of active components in some crops, there is a higher emphasis on much better understanding of readily available control choices (Hillocks 2012 ). Regulatory standards that restrict using particular pesticides or promote using others can have a significant influence on IPM implementation.</p>
<p>Pest management needs a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied just after regular monitoring indicates that a pest population had actually reached a financial limit level. Lots of individual product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM indicates for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in limited areas.</p>
