We generally recommend pest control chemicals that get the job done using the least quantity of item. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last option). These avoidance and control methods consist of biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, hereditary, chemical, and regulatory methods.</p>
<p>The concept of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable method for managing pests, has actually been in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt toxins are planted in millions of hectares worldwide. Freezer is likewise considered a physical control and, although it does not always eliminate the insect pests, it at least stops their development and additional feeding on the saved crop.</p>
